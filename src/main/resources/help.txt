Daily Checklist Help
====================

Daily Checklist is a focused app for managing daily routines (not general todo history).
It records whether a task was completed each day but resets status daily. This app is
designed for quick, repeatable daily checklists rather than long-lived task tracking.

Welcome! This guide explains the core features: daily tasks, custom checklists, reminders,
search, and the focus timer.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Launch the app: run `java -jar dailychecklist.jar` or double-click the JAR file.
2. Main interface: a split layout shows Daily tasks (left) and Custom checklists (right).

Managing Daily Tasks
--------------------

Adding a new daily task
- Click the "Add Task" button or press Ctrl+A.
- Enter a name (e.g., "Morning Exercise").
- Choose Morning or Evening and frequency (Daily / Weekday / Specific Day).
- Click "Add Task" — it appears in the left panel under the chosen time.

Viewing and editing daily tasks
- The left panel groups tasks by Morning and Evening.
- Use the "Show weekday tasks" option to include weekday-only items.
- Right-click a task to rename or remove it, or start the focus timer.

Completing tasks
- Click a task's checkbox to toggle completion.
- Click or double-click task text to select or toggle.
- Multi-select with Ctrl+click; range-select with Shift+click.
- Tasks reset daily; completion does not carry over.

Custom Checklists
-----------------

Create a checklist
- In the right panel, enter a name and click "Create Checklist". The name cannot be empty.

Add tasks to a checklist
- Select a checklist, enter tasks (one per line) in the Add Tasks area, and click "Add Tasks".
- Empty lines are skipped. Tasks appear in the selected checklist.

Manage checklists
- Right-click a checklist to Rename, Delete, Add Reminder or View/Edit Reminders.
- Checklists with reminders show a clock icon in the UI (see the Reminder Icon Guide).

Editing custom tasks
- Toggle completion with the checkbox; double-click to rename; right-click for more options.
- Drag and drop tasks to reorder or move between checklists.

Searching Tasks
---------------

- Press Ctrl+F or use the Search menu to open the search dialog.
- Type to filter tasks across all checklists in real time (case-insensitive).
- Select a result and click "Go to Selected Task" to jump to it in the UI.

Reminders
---------

Add and manage
- Right-click a checklist → Add Reminder. Set date and time.
- Right-click → View/Edit Reminders to modify or delete reminders.

Notification states
- Future (blue clock): scheduled more than 60 minutes away.
- Due soon (yellow clock): within the next 60 minutes.
- Overdue (red clock): scheduled time has passed.
- Very overdue: UI indicates critical overdue reminders (e.g., 'Zzz').

Focus Timer
-----------

Start a timer
- Right-click a task → Start Focus Timer. Enter minutes (e.g., 25) and start.

During the timer
- A countdown window appears; circles visually indicate elapsed intervals.
- Controls: Space = Pause/Resume, Enter = Start (when paused).

Settings & Troubleshooting
--------------------------

- Access settings via the menu bar to customize defaults (timer length, etc.).
- App won't start: verify Java with `java -version`.
- Data loading issues: see restore options in the File menu and backups in your user folder.
- Tasks not saving: check file permissions. Data files are stored under your user directory.

Data Backup and Recovery
------------------------

- Backups are stored in `dailychecklist-backups` in your user directory.
- The app makes automatic backups on startup and periodically.
- To recover, use the File → Restore from Backup flow in the app (it backs up your live data first).

Keyboard Shortcuts
------------------

- Add Task: Ctrl+A
- Search Tasks: Ctrl+F
- Refresh Tasks: F5
- Multi-select: Ctrl+click
- Range-select: Shift+click
- Delete selected tasks: Delete
- Timer pause/resume: Space

Reminder Icon Guide
